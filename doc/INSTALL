slkbuild: arch-like wrapper script for easy packaging

This distribution will run on most UNIX systems.
Its currently developed under Linux.  With little work it should
work with most UNIX-like systems.

Installing
---------

The preferred method for installing slkbuild is to use the "configure" scripts
compatible with most UNIX systems that contain "/bin/sh" or equivalent
(even the Window's Cygwin setup will work with this).

To install slkbuild on these platforms run the following commands:

    ./configure
    make install

There are several optional parameters that you may pass to the configure
script to customize slkbuild for your applications.  Run "./configure --help"
for a complete list of options.

If your system works with the "configure" script then you are done.

	  * remove the usr/info/dir file if present

	  * added creation of package.src file from template from SLKBUILD sourcetemplate variable
- v1.4.3 (February 23, 2008)

	  *changes in buildfile creation naming, now it's build-$pkgname-$pkgver-$zenver.$pkgrel.log, thanks to George Vlahavas for the suggestion

	  *added support to move svg icons to usr/share/icons/hicolor/scalable/apps/
	  *added nostrip option to prevent the execution of the stripping function, can be useful in some applications, that break if they are stripped, like acroread
